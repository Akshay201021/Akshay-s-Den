         <h3>Tennis Scoring</h3>
         <h4>Description</h4>
         A game consists of a sequence of points played with the same player serving, and is won by the first side to have won at least four points with a
          margin of two points or more over their opponent. Normally the server's score is always called first and the receiver's score second.
           Score calling in tennis is unusual in that (except in tie-breaks) each point has a
          corresponding call that is different from its point value. The current point score is announced orally before each point by the umpire, or by the server if there is no umpire.
          For instance, if the server has won three points so far in the game, and the non-server has won one, the score is "40–15".
When both sides have won the same number of points within a given game—i.e., when each side has won one, or two, points—the score is described as "15 all" and "30 all", respectively.
 However, if each player has won three points, the score is called as "deuce", not "40 all". From that point on in the game, whenever the score is tied, it is described as "deuce" 
 regardless of how many points have been played.
However, if the score is called in French, for example at the French Open, the first occurrence of "40 all" in a single game may be called as such ("40-A", "Quarante-A", or 
"Quarante partout"). Thereafter, "deuce" ("Égalité" in French) is used for all other occurrences when the score returns to "40 all" within the same game.
In standard play, scoring beyond a "deuce" score, in which the players have scored three points each, requires that one player must get two points ahead in order to win the game. 
This type of tennis scoring is known as "advantage scoring" (or "ads"). The side which wins the next point after deuce is said to have the advantage. If they lose the next point, 
the score is again deuce, since the score is tied. If the side with the advantage wins the next point, that side has won the game, since they have a lead of two points. 
When the server is the player with the advantage, the score may be called as "advantage in". When the server's opponent has the advantage, the score may be called as
 "advantage out". These phrases are sometimes shortened to "ad in" or "van in" (or "my ad") and "ad out" (or "your ad"). Alternatively, the players' names are used: 
 in professional tournaments the umpire announces the score in this format (e.g., "advantage Nadal" or "advantage Williams").
In the USTA rule book (but not the ITF rules), there is the following comment: " 'Zero,' 'one,' 'two,' and 'three,' may be substituted for 'Love', '15', '30', and '40.' 
This is particularly appropriate for matches with an inexperienced player or in which one player does not understand English."
For tie-breaks, the calls are simply the number of points won by each player:
<h4>Scoring a Tiebreaker Game</h4>
At a score of six all, a set is often determined by one more game called a "twelve point tiebreaker" (or just "tiebreak"). 
Only one more game is played to determine the winner of the set; the score of the resulting completed set is 7–6 or 6–7 
(though it can be six all if a player retires before completion). Points are counted using ordinary numbering. The set 
is won by the player who has scored at least seven points in the tiebreak and at least two points more than their opponent.
 For example, if the score is six points to five and the player with six points wins the next point, they win the tiebreak 
 (seven points to five), as well as the set (seven games to six). If the player with five points wins the point instead (for a score of six all),
  the tiebreak continues and cannot be won on the next point (7–6 or 6–7), since no player will be two points ahead. In the scoring of the set, 
  sometimes the tiebreak points are shown as well as the game count, e.g., 7–610–8. Another way of listing the score of the tiebreak is to list
   only the loser's points. For example, if the set score is listed as 7–6(8), the tiebreak score was 10–8 (since the eight is the loser's score,
    and the winner must win by two points). Similarly, 7–6(3) means the tiebreak score was 7–3. The player who would normally be serving after 6–6 is 
    the one to serve first in the tiebreak, and the tiebreak is considered a service game for this player. The server begins his or her service from the 
    deuce court and serves one point. After the first point, the serve changes to the first server's opponent. Each player then serves two consecutive points 
    for the remainder of the tiebreak. The first of each two-point sequence starts from the server's advantage court and the second starts from the deuce court.
     In this way, the sum of the scores is even when the server serves from the deuce court. After every six points, the players switch ends of the court; note
      that the side-changes during the tiebreak will occur in the middle of a server's two-point sequence. At the end of the tiebreak, the players switch ends of 
      the court again, since the set score is always odd (13 games). An alternative tie-break system called the "Coman Tie-Break" is sometimes used by the United States
       Tennis Association. Scoring is the same, but end changes take place after the first point and then after every four points. This approach allows the servers of
        doubles teams to continue serving from the same end of the court as during the body of the set. It also reduces the advantage the elements (e.g. wind and sun) 
        could give playing the first six points of a seven-point tiebreak on one side of the court. Another tie-break system is called the "super tie-breaker" 
        and it consists of one player reaching a total of 10 points. The player must win by two points so there is no limit to the highest number of points. 
        A typically close score may look like 10–8. At Wimbledon, a tie-break was not played in the final set until the score reaches 12 all. At the Australian Open,
         a tie-break was played in the final set at six all, but continued until one player had ten points and was leading by two. The US Open used a conventional,
          first to seven tie-break at six all in the final set. The French Open was the only Grand Slam or professional tournament where a final-set tie-break was
           not played and it was played as an advantage set 
until the 2022 edition. In March 2022, the French Open and all other Grand Slams adopted the “10-point tie-break” when the 5th set reaches six games all (6–6).
<h3>Match Score</h3>
<h4>Description</h4>
The winner is the side that wins more than half of the sets, and the match ends as soon as this is achieved. Men's matches may be the best of either three or
 five sets, while women's and mixed doubles matches are usually best of three sets.
The alternation of service between games continues throughout the match without regard to sets, but the ends are changed after each odd game within a set
 (including the last game). If, for example, the second set of a match ends with the score at 6–3, 1–6, the ends are changed as the last game played was the 
 7th (odd) game of the set and in spite of it being the 16th (even) game of the match. Even when a set ends with an odd game, ends are again changed after the 
 first game of the following set. A tiebreaker game is treated as a single game for the purposes of this alternation. Since tiebreakers always result in a score of 7–6,
  there is always a court change after the tiebreaker.
The score of a complete match may be given simply by sets won, or with the scores in each set given separately. In either case, the match winner's score is stated first. 
In the former, shorter form, a match might be listed as 3–1 (i.e. three sets to one). In the latter form, this same match might be further described as "7–5, 6–7(4–7), 6–4, 7–6(8–6)".
 (As noted above, an alternate form of writing the tiebreak score lists only the loser's score – e.g., "7–6(6)" for the fourth set in the example.) This match was won three sets to one, 
 with the match loser winning the second set on a tiebreaker. The numbers in parentheses, normally included in printed scorelines but omitted when spoken,
 indicate the duration of the tiebreaker following a given set. Here, the match winner lost the second-set tiebreaker 7–4 and won the fourth-set tiebreaker 8–6.
