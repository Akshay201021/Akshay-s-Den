                    <h3>Manner of Play</h3>
                    <h4>Court</h4>
 Tennis is played on a rectangular, flat surface. The court is 78 feet (23.77 m) long, and 27 feet (8.2 m) wide for singles matches and 36 ft (11 m) for doubles matches. Additional 
clear space around the court is required in order for players to reach overrun balls. A net is stretched across the full width of the court, parallel with the baselines, dividing it
into two equal ends. It is held up by either a cord or metal cable of diameter no greater than 0.8 cm (1⁄3 in).[65] The net is 3 feet 6 inches (1.07 m) high at the posts and 3 feet 
(0.91 m) high in the centre.[66] The net posts are 3 feet (0.91 m) outside the doubles court on each side or, for a singles net, 3 feet (0.91 m) outside the singles court on each side.
  The modern tennis court owes its design to Major Walter Clopton Wingfield. In 1873, Wingfield patented a court much the same as the current one for his stické tennis (sphairistike). 
This template was modified in 1875 to the court design that exists today, with markings similar to Wingfield's version, but with the hourglass shape of his court changed to a rectangle. 
Tennis is unusual in that it is played on a variety of surfaces.[68] Grass, clay, and hard courts of concrete 
or asphalt topped with acrylic are the most common. Occasionally carpet is used for indoor play, with hardwood flooring having been historically used. Artificial turf courts can also be 
                    found.
                    <h4>Lines</h4>  The lines that delineate the width of the court are called the baseline (farthest back)
and the service line (middle of the court). The short mark in the centre of each baseline is referred to as either the hash mark or the centre mark. 
The outermost lines that make up the length are called the doubles sidelines; they are the boundaries for doubles matches. The lines to the inside of 
 the doubles sidelines are the singles sidelines, and are the boundaries in singles play. The area between a doubles sideline and the nearest singles 
  sideline is called the doubles alley, playable in doubles play. The line that runs across the centre of a player's side of the court is called the service 
line because the serve must be delivered into the area between the service line and the net on the receiving side. Despite its name, this is not where a player 
 legally stands when making a serve.
The line dividing the service line in two is called the centre line or centre service line. The boxes this centre line creates are called the service boxes; depending on a player's position,
 they have to hit the ball into one of these when serving. A ball is out only if none of it has hit the area inside the lines, or the line, upon its first bounce. 
 All lines are required to be between 1 and 2 inches (25 and 51 mm) in width, 
with the exception of the baseline which can be up to 4 inches (100 mm) wide, although in practice it is often the same width as the others.
<h4>Play of a single point</h4>
The players or teams start on opposite sides of the net. One player is designated the server, and the opposing player is the receiver.
 The choice to be server or receiver in the first game and the choice of ends is decided by a coin toss before the warm-up starts. Service alternates game by game 
 between the two players or teams. For each point, the server starts behind the baseline, between the centre mark and the sideline. The receiver may start anywhere 
 on their side of the net. When the receiver is ready, the server will serve, although the receiver must play to the pace of the server. For a service to be legal, 
 the ball must travel over the net without touching it into the diagonally opposite service box. If the ball hits the net but lands in the service box, this is a let 
 or net service, which is void, and the server retakes that serve. The player can serve any number of let services in a point and they are always treated as voids and 
 not as faults. A fault is a serve that falls long or wide of the service box, or does not clear the net. There is also a "foot fault" when a player's foot touches the
  baseline or an extension of the centre mark before the ball is hit. If the second service, after a fault, is also a fault, the server double faults, and the receiver 
  wins the point. However, if the serve is in, it is considered a legal service. A legal service starts a rally, in which the players alternate hitting the ball across 
  the net. A legal return consists of a player hitting the ball so that it falls in the server's court, before it has bounced twice or hit any fixtures except the net. 
  A player or team cannot hit the ball twice in a row. The ball must travel over or round the net into the other players' court. A ball that hits the net during a rally 
  is considered a legal return as long as it crosses into the opposite side of the court. 
The first player or team to fail to make a legal return loses the point. The server then moves to the other side of the service line at the start of a new point.
<h4>Game</h4>
A game consists of a sequence of points played with the same player serving. A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least 
two points more than the opponent. The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to three points are
 described as "love", "15", "30", and "40", respectively. If at least three points have been scored by each player, making the player's scores equal 
 at 40 apiece, the score is not called out as "40–40", but rather as "deuce". If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has 
 one more point than his opponent, the score of the game is "advantage" for the player in the lead. During informal games, advantage can also be called 
 "ad in" or "van in" when the serving player is ahead, and "ad out" or "van out" when the receiving player is ahead; alternatively, either player may simply
  call out "my ad" or "your ad" during informal play. The score of a tennis game during play is always read with the serving player's score first. In tournament play, 
the chair umpire calls the point count (e.g., "15–love") after each point. At the end of a game, the chair umpire also announces the winner of the game and the overall score.         
<h4>Set</h4>
A set consists of a sequence of games played with service alternating between games, ending when the count of games won meets certain criteria. Typically, 
a player wins a set by winning at least six games and at least two games more than the opponent. If one player has won six games and the opponent five, 
an additional game is played. If the leading player wins that game, the player wins the set 7–5. If the trailing player wins the game (tying the set 6–6)
 a tiebreak is played. A tiebreak, played under a separate set of rules, allows one player to win one more game and thus the set, to give a final set score of 7–6. 
 A tiebreak game can be won by scoring at least seven points and at least two points more than the opponent. In a tiebreak, two players serve by 'ABBA' system which
 has been proven to be fair.[73] If a tiebreak is not played, the set is referred to as an advantage set, where the set continues without limit until one player leadsby
  a two-game margin. A "love set" means that the loser of the set won zero games, colloquially termed a "jam donut" in the US.[74] In tournament
 play, the chair umpire announces the winner of the set and the overall score. 
 The final score in sets is always read with the winning player's score first, e.g. "6–2, 4–6, 6–0, 7–5".      
 <h4>Match</h4>
 A match consists of a sequence of sets. The outcome is determined through a best of three or five sets system. On the professional circuit,
  men play best-of-five-set matches at all four Grand Slam tournaments, Davis Cup, and the final of the Olympic Games and best-of-three-set 
  matches at all other tournaments, while women play best-of-three-set matches at all tournaments. The first player to win two sets in a best-of-three, 
  or three sets in a best-of-five, wins the match.[75] Only in the final sets of matches at the French Open, the Olympic Games, and Fed Cup are tiebreaks 
  not played. In these cases, sets are played indefinitely until one player has a two-game lead, occasionally leading to some remarkably long matches. In tournament play,
  the chair umpire announces the end of the match with the well-known phrase "Game, set, match" followed by the winning person's or team's name.
